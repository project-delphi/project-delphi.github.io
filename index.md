Hello there! I'm Ravi Kalia.

I have experience with a wide repertoire of ML/DL (Computer Vision and NLP) techniques in business/tech, backend development into APIs on trading exchanges, Web Development and MLOps/DevOps Projects using AGILE/SCRUM methods. I love programming in the web (client & server) and speak internationally at conferences on the modern functional programming paradigm which creates clean, clear & concise computational prose. I am knowledgeable in Docker, Python, R, Spark and JavaScript/Node. I like to use modern frameworks: On the BackEnd, Node is a joy. For ML I use the python ecosystem - MLib, PyTorch, TensorFlow, sklearn/numpy and in the past R. For FrontEnd I've spent time with React, VueJS, Angular and VanillaJS. Recently, I have worked with smart contracts and blockchain technology. I'm fluent in Spanish.

As a machine learning enthusiast I developed the ability to create profitable ML products suitable to market opportunities. I enjoy working in groups with developers, pair programming, implementing, presenting and sharing good practice.

I'm interested in scaling up and reducing technical debt in Productionized Machine Learning Systems, what is now called MLOps.
