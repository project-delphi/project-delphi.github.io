Investigating fixed effects, random effects, mixed effects I felt queasy having to remember all these terms. It reminded me of [lasso & ridge regression or L1 & L2]. Naming styles in statistics often feel unnecessarily complicated compared to computer science names. 

This [post](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2005/01/25/why_i_dont_use/) from Andrew Gelman made me think of mirror universes from the Star Trek Genre. It's just so much nicer to think of all these effects as just being generated by hierarchical models.

His point holds, many frequentist family models are just one or other way of saying things that might naturally be framed as Bayesian problems.

What has me interested, is if it's possible to model the fixed and random effects of feature weights through re-sampling strategies. I've never seen that done before.

Great. Research. Topic.
