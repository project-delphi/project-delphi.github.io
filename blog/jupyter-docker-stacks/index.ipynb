    "## DevOps\n",
    "\n",
    "On and Off, I have about 6 years of experience with DevOps methodology. It’s moved so fast and keeps going that early experiences with Chef, Ansible and earlier versions of Docker seem irrelevant. One sticking point I remember is the introduction of Docker and how it affected developers on Apple appliances. The Mac operating systems (OSX, macOS) have traditionally not played well with Docker.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](http://blog.adnansiddiqi.me/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/docker_logo.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, Docker and DevOps generally allow careful dependency management. This is important particularly as I recently saw [Dependency Hell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell), and probably not for the last time. Reproducible results are a must and not a nice to have. Dependency hell really gets in the way of that. \n",
    "\n",
    "As I mentioned Docker has traditionally played so slow on Apple products as to be an anti-pattern.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "This is do with how persistent data has been shared between Mac and running docker containers - very slowly using a concept of volumes. Let’s explain this below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Darwin Is Not Linux\n",
    "\n",
    "There’s a long story about how Steve Jobs resurrected Apple. As a precursor he was involved in Next computers which developed a unix like OS called Darwin. In fact Darwin is a fork of BSD - Berkeley Software Distribution - itself based on UNIX. Linux meanwhile is a different OS, inspired by UNIX. \n",
    "\n",
    "Docker relies on a linux-containers, and runs lightweight and fast in them. Apple OS’es don’t have linux-containers. Hence to run Docker on Apple and Microsoft has needed a VM of Linux - usually VirtualBox or VMWare. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the past, using Docker on a Mac needed installing a specific version of VM software and hoping it would work well with Docker. This VM is the reason for the slowness Docker, in particular read/writes, on Apple. \n",
    "\n",
    "So much so, that hackernews and reddit have been full of the anti-pattern of Docker on Apple.  This is because Docker has to talk to the VM which then talks to Apple OS and then talks to the hardware. There is the slowness.\n",
    "\n",
    "## File I/O\n",
    "\n",
    "The major slowness is observed when there is file I/O between the docker instance and the host OS. Docker abstracts the concept of read/writing between the host OS (in our case Apple) and the Docker instance as volumes. Volumes link directories in the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Docker Toolbox\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from the slowness, the other issue has been getting a VM software to run on Apple. Docker released Docker Toolbox, which packages VirtualBox and Docker for legacy Apple and Windows OS’es - such as OSX. \n",
    "\n",
    "This takes some of the pain out of installation and configuration. However latency remains pretty bad.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Docker For Mac\n",
    "\n",
    "There’s a new tool called Docker for Mac. This is making use of macOS container technologies directly and removes the need for a guest linux VM.\n",
    "\n",
    "I’ve been running it and can attest that it is more lightweight and my Mac doesn’t sound like an airplane taking off with Docker running anymore.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Volumes are now better\n",
    "\n",
    "There’s been some clever work with volumes. delegated status allows the communication between Docker instances and macOS to run faster - still not as fast as linux containers, but much better than before.\n",
