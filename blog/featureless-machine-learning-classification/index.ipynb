    "# Classification Without Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification is applicable to new instances of categorical data - data that belongs to one of several types (or classes), the number of classes usually inferred from the data. This is discrete data. The major types of classes are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* binary (only two classes)\n",
    "* multinomial (K classes with $K \\geq 1$)\n",
    "* ordinal (K classes with an ordering relation between them)\n",
    "\n",
    "When there are no features, we can work with categorical data:\n",
    "\n",
    "* describe the data with the distribution over the classes\n",
    "* summarize the distribution with statistics\n",
    "* instantiate classifiers that make use of the distribution\n",
    "* generate sample variates from the distribution\n",
    "* make use of bar charts, pie charts and tables to specify the distribution\n",
    "* produce ROC, AUC metrics and their charts for featureless classifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If the data is a sample (usually the case), then the sample distribution is used as a proxy for the true distribution. The other useful strategy is use ensembling (such as bootstrap) to have a more robust (and less sticky to the data) estimate of the distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the number of classes, K is very large (>15) - then interpreting charts becomes almost impossible - other than coarse proportions of the most frequent classes. The relativities don't come across well in charts or tables - so understanding is lost - unless the distribution is flat or dominated by a few classes; one might do well to aggregate the classes back up again.\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's roll these descriptions and predictions out using pandas, statsmodels, seaborn and sklearn."
