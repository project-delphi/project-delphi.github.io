I found myself Googling for a refresher on hierarchical models and random effects approaches to weights that have their own distribution. The terms that kept occurring where:

* `fixed` effects
* `random` effects
* `mixed` effects
* Bayesian Hierarchical Models

And then I remembered `main` effects and `interaction` effects. Feeling more confident in the terminology of both frequentist `random effects` and Bayesian `hierarchical models` - being two sides of the same coin, I felt quite pleased.

As I kept trawling, I came across a post from noted and prolific blogging Bayesian - [Andrew Gelman](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/). He had a [post](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2011/12/17/ripley-on-model-selection-and-some-links-on-exploratory-model-analysis/) about model selection mentioning my doctoral supervisor [Professor Ripley](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~ripley/). It was good, and a reference to a talk I had not seen - so many ideas now mainstream and well elucidated are in this paper.

I believe Google's search engine had linked my previous search history to this query. I confirmed that incognito, this same links do not appear.
