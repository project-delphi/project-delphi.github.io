After I spoke at PyData Montreal about maintaining code quality in data science/machine learning - I showed a cleaned up PageRank on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank).

It got me thinking. There really should be code guidelines and a major clean up effort in the wikipedia sections for Machine Learning/Statistics.

Something like a guidelines document for the major languages would be great. In addition, an effort to clean up code fragments on say the first 100, then next 400 articles in Machine Learning - that's important.

Why do this? Wikipedia is a resource for the whole world. THe more people that are exposed to good coding guidelines, the healthier our community will be.

Community. Matters.
