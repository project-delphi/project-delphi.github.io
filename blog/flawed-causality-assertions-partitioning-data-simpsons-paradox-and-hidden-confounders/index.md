I've been thinking more and more about the value of partitioning data and then implying causation. There's a lot going on in this space. In fact - I'm behind a few books on the methodolgy in causality.

However, partitioning data and implying causation from p-values makes me cringe. It happens regularly, since the subtleness of causal reasoning can be difficult to fathom.

I'm planning to fill out a sequence of posts on a number of related topics, but for now I'll just stub some concepts.

## Partitioning Data

## Hacking p-values

## Confounders

## Hidden Confounders

## Simpson's Paradox

## Bayesian Perspective

## Never Ending Confounders
