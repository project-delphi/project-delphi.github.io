Yesterday, I spoke at PyData Montreal. It was a lot of fun to discuss MLOps - particularly the parellels to DevOps advancement. 

I spoke to an individual about a contradiction in my talk. I discussed the friction in taking data products to production.

I first talked about how building a team with:

* Data Scientists (ML Researchers)
* ML Engineers/Software Engineers
* Deployment Specialists

is one way to scale product development. However I also noted the issue with ownership and understanding of the product can get muddled. Translating the product in intermediate steps can lose intention from product ideation to deployment.

I also ended with a quote:

> People who write the models/algorithms should be the ones to implement them.


So there's the contradiction.

After some thinking, it can be resolved as has been happening with software development - particularly web development. We need superbly easy-to-use tools that can be managed by a team of software/ml engineers who can continuously iterate in short cycles with automated guardrails.

Once that happens, individual members of teams will rotate between roles and get experience (possibly mastery) across the board in ML development.
